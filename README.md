### Code Genres
* Truth be told, I came up with the concept of "Code Genres", and the exact term iself, independently of anyone else;
* However, while I was doing my requisite searches for "prior art", I discovered that someone had beat me to it;
* And so I must give props and kudos and all credit to the owner of this Github repository: [mobileink/codegenres] (https://github.com/mobileink/codegenres);
* (more to come...)
